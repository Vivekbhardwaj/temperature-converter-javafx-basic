"A beginner friendly basic javafx desktop application."
It can be of great help, understanding the basic structure of the a desktop app.
And an oveview of flow of code.

JavaFX is a software platform for creating and delivering desktop applications, as well as rich Internet applications (RIAs) that can run across a wide variety of devices. JavaFX was developed with an intent to replace Swing as the standard GUI library for Java SE.

Oracle 'Premier Support' for JavaFX is also available, for the current long-term version (Java JDK 8), through March 2022

REMEMBER
Since the JDK 11 release in 2018, JavaFX is part of the open-source OpenJDK, under the OpenJFX project.
In order to use it with java 11,ensure downloading javaFX module ,extract at an appropriate location,
and make sure it is added to the project.

Also add the path below to the VM options under Run menu:
--module-path /home/vivek/Downloads/javafx-sdk-11.0.2/lib --add-modules=javafx.controls,javafx.fxml 

to ensure java compiler adds required javafx modules during compilation

(Feel free to add basic stuff to the app)
Hope to learn from the community.
